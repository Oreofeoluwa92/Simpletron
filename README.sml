Description:Simpletron is a simulated computer that processes a simple assembly-like language. It allows users to learn the basics of how a computer executes instructions step-by-step. This simulator works by reading a sequence of instructions, executing them, and displaying the result.

SimpletronV2 is a Java-based (SML) simulator that emulates a simple machine with 10,000 words of memory and a variety of operations. It stimulates a primitive computer system that can load and execute programs written in Simpletron Machine Language (SML). The Simulator can read input from both the keyboard and from a file, allowing you to load, execute and interact with SML programs.

In writing this code so many consultations where made in understanding it a bit.

Implementation: To Run, type and run the following command in the terminal "java SimpletronV2"

After launching the program, the simulator will prompt you to either load a program from a file or enter it manually.

To load from a file, type "Y" when prompted and provide the filename (.sml file or txt). To enter manually, type "N" and input each instruction one by one, ending with the keyword "GO"

Once the program is loaded, the simulator will automatically execute the instructions in memory.
